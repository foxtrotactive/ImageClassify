# **AI Computer Vision Fundamentals: Image Classifier with PyTorch**

## **Goal**  
Learn the fundamentals of AI Computer Vision (CV) by building a **simple image classifier** using **PyTorch**. The project will cover key concepts such as loading and processing image data, building a neural network, training a model, and evaluating its performance.

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on implementing an image classifier from scratch using PyTorch. It’s designed as a hands-on way to explore core concepts in deep learning and computer vision. The classifier will recognize images from a specific dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST, or a custom dataset).  

The workflow includes:  
1. **Data Preparation:** Loading and transforming images.  
2. **Model Architecture:** Designing and implementing a neural network.  
3. **Training:** Optimizing the model with backpropagation.  
4. **Evaluation:** Testing the model on unseen data.  
5. **Visualization:** Displaying results, such as accuracy graphs or misclassified images.

## **Project Workflow**  

### **1. Setup Environment**  
- Install Python and PyTorch.  
- Install required libraries: `torchvision`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.  
- Prepare the dataset and ensure it’s available for training.  

### **2. Data Preprocessing**  
- Load the dataset using `torchvision.datasets`.  
- Apply transformations (e.g., resizing, normalization) using `torchvision.transforms`.  
- Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets.  

### **3. Model Design**  
- Define the architecture of your neural network using `torch.nn`.  
- Include convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.  
- Add dropout layers (optional) to reduce overfitting.  

### **4. Training**  
- Define a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss).  
- Select an optimizer (e.g., SGD, Adam) and specify the learning rate.  
- Train the model for several epochs and monitor loss and accuracy.  

### **5. Evaluation**  
- Test the model on unseen data.  
- Visualize a confusion matrix to analyze model predictions.  
- Generate a classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).  

### **6. Results Visualization**  
- Plot training and validation loss over epochs.  
- Display correctly classified and misclassified images.
